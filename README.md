# Mapping robot project experiment

Goals:

 - Learn some electronics
 - Write some interesting embedded software
 - Experiment with developing teaching materials

## Tools

 - KiCad 5.1.6


## Notes

 - All KiCad projects need to include path to top-level `lib`
   directory as a project-specific library path. This should be set up
   as a path relative to `${KIPRJMOD}`.
