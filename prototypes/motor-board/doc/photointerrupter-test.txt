 - Current limiting resistor on IR LED = 81.7 Ohm
 - Detector resistor = 5.7 k Ohm
 - Supply voltage = 3.313 V
 - "Light" voltage = 3.221 V
 - "Dark" voltage = 0.9 mV - 91.1 mV (depends on exact location of
   occluder and amount of ambient radiation excluded)

=>

 - Light current = 56.5 mA
 - Dark current = 0.158 - 15.9 uA
